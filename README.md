## What is Always Awake

Always Awake is a Auto Hotkey script that jiggles the mouse by 1 pixel to keep your pc awake. Mouse movement is so little you won't notice during use. Useful for long remote sessions on a person machine without needing to change settings. Includes an exe that could be run without auto hot key installed. 

## Use
Run exe and use <kbd>enter</kbd> to exit script
